# Digit classification using the softmax activation function

## The neural network used in this model:

</p>

### The accuracy of the model is approximatly :

+ On the trainning set = 99.9%
+ On the test set = 97.9 %

### The link to the app to test the model:

### Some informations:
<b>The accuracy is less precise in the app because the sketchpad does not center the digits so the model gets confused</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>I will work on that in the future, the important part is the model's accuracy not the app.</b>
